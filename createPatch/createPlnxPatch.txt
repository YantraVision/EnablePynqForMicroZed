clone repo :https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx/tree/master
git branch plnx version
i.e.git branch xilinx_rebase_v4.14

now change in the code as you want.
than git diff > yourchanges.patch

Now include this patch in the plnx project.
You can follow the the example of linux directory.

-in the plnx project go to project-spec/meta-user/ than recipe-kernel(if recipe-kernel note there then create)
-now same as linux directory add path in the :linux-xlnx_%.bbappend 
-create a module directory
 now create a directory i.e.kernel-module-v4l2 and create a bbapend file as as the name of dirctory kernel-module-v4l2_%.bbappend.
 add you pacth file in the kernel-module-v4l2 repo and kernel-module-v4l2_%.bbappend.

Now build the kernel:
petalinux-build -c kernel and your patch will apply in the new image file.
